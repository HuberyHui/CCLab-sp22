    <h3>Imaginary Creature</h3>
    <p1 id="intro">This project is called Imaginary creature. I draw this in p5.js editor.</p1>
    <p2 class="para">For this animal, I pay special attention to the abstract, I imagine an animal similar to the fox with wings, antelope, wildebeest body, I think this animal can be traced in many interesting legends.</p2>
    <p3 class="para">The first thing is composition. I drew this picture on a flat plate and set up a rectangular coordinate system, which made it a lot easier for me to write code. I then restored the object on the computer based on what I had drawn, and did some basic coloring to give the image more texture</p3>
    <p4 class="para">To sum up, I think the most difficult thing about this painting is that it is very random, and assumptions can be easily established and overturned, which makes it hard to concentrate. I finally decided on the theme after painting, and I think it really helps to paint before writing the code</p4>
